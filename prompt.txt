Build me a React blackjack training app with these features:

Only plays soft hands, pair splits.

Supports betting, auto-deal, double down (DAS allowed), and split Aces get only one card each.

Blackjack pays 3:2 automatically.

The dealer’s hole card is hidden until their turn. Add a short pause before the dealer plays.

Show player’s bankroll updates with a clear indication when it changes.

Add sound effects and animations for dealing, flipping, and winning.

Add graphics for cards and chips (no plain text hands).

After each move, tell the player if it was correct or incorrect based on basic strategy (S17, no surrender, DAS allowed).

Strategy includes pairs, soft totals, and hard totals:

Pairs: Split A,A and 8,8 always. 10-value pairs (10/J/Q/K) → Stand. 9,9 split vs 2–9 except 7. 7,7 split vs 2–7. 6,6 split vs 2–6. 4,4 split vs 5–6. 3,3 & 2,2 split vs 2–7. Otherwise hit.

Soft hands: A2–A3 double vs 5–6 else hit. A4–A5 double vs 4–6 else hit. A6 double vs 3–6 else hit. A7 double vs 3–6; stand vs 2,7,8; hit vs 9,10,A. A8+ stand.

Hard hands: 17+ stand. 13–16 stand vs 2–6 else hit. 12 stand vs 4–6 else hit. 11 double vs any. 10 double vs 2–9 else hit. 9 double vs 3–6 else hit. 8 or less hit.

Hide the Split button for ten-value pairs (10/J/Q/K).

Include basic strategy tests to confirm logic.
